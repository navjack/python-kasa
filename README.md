The only thing I'm contributing to this are some things i wanted to do for my own use. I wanted a way to control my Kasa RGB bulbs and while you can do that with this Python library I wanted to interface with it in a different way. So, I wrote a quick and dirty PowerShell script that made it easier for me to call the Python library in VSCode on my Mac. 

```PowerShell
# put variables together to form the command to change the color of the selected bulb
$bulbcolorchangecmd = $commandstart + $bulbip + $typebulb + $hsvcmd

# write host $bulbcolorchangecmd to see what the command looks like
Write-Host $bulbcolorchangecmd

# run $bulbcolorchangecmd in the macos zsh shell
Invoke-Expression -Command $bulbcolorchangecmd
```

Simple stuff like this let me bypass what shell VSCode would open. Just going straight to ZSH which has Python-Kasa running happily in it (is it the Brew version? or one of the other...

many others doesn't matter now.

I hope to get all of the functionality i want essentially prototyped in PowerShell by invoking the Python library and then taking all that into its own self-contained thing in Go or Rust or something that can easily spit out binaries that can run on my PC and my Mac.
